# Value at Risk (JPM) — Historical VaR & Monte Carlo Simulation

**Objective:**  
Quantify market risk for **JPMorgan Chase (JPM)** using both **Historical Value at Risk (HVaR)** and **Monte Carlo Simulation VaR (MCVaR)** based on actual return distributions and simulated scenarios.

### 🔍 Key Findings (based on uploaded project):
- **Historical VaR (95% confidence): –2.23%**, implying a **$6.69 expected loss** at the current price of $306.10.  
- **Historical VaR (99% confidence): –3.99%**, implying a **$11.94 loss**.  
- **Monte Carlo VaR (95% confidence): –2.62%**, slightly more conservative than HVaR.  
- **Monte Carlo VaR (99% confidence): –3.48%**, suggesting lower tail-risk than historical extreme events.  
- Simulated returns range approximately from **–6.59% to +5.06%**.  
- Daily returns distribution shows clear **fat-tail behavior**, indicating non-normal return structure.
